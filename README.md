# Welcome to my CheckIO repository!

The purpose of this repository is to share my [*Checkio*](www.checkio.org) task solutions. [*Checkio*](www.checkio.org) is a game for learning [*Python*](https://www.python.org) in an amusement way. Our mentors at CodeCool offered us [*Checkio*](www.checkio.org) to reduce our stress if we cannot do anything with ourselves. To tell the truth, I have solved quite few tasks of it.

No further comments, just come on and have a look at it. Thanx!
